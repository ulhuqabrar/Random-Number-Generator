# 🎲 Random Number Generator

A lightweight, responsive, and beginner-friendly **Random Number Generator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Whether you're building a game, conducting a raffle, or just exploring how randomness works in code, this project gives you a solid foundation in JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

## 📌 Overview

This web app lets users generate random numbers with the click of a button. The number updates dynamically on the screen, styled with a modern and intuitive interface. It’s a great starter project for anyone learning front-end development and looking to experiment with JavaScript functionality.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎰 **Single Click Randomization** – Instantly generate a new number with one click.
- 🎯 **Simple & Clean UI** – Designed with user experience in mind.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- 🛠️ **Easy to Extend** – Add min-max range input, sound effects, or animations with minimal effort.
- ⚡ **Fast Performance** – No dependencies or libraries required; just open and use.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The JavaScript file (`index.js`) uses the built-in `Math.random()` function to generate a decimal between 0 and 1.
- This decimal is then scaled and converted to a whole number (e.g., 1 to 100).
- The number is displayed in real-time by updating a DOM element (`innerText` or `textContent`).
- You can modify the code to accept user-defined ranges or generate other formats like decimals or even alphanumeric strings.
